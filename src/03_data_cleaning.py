Stage 3: Data Cleaning and Geocoding
================================================================================
PSEUDO-CODE — documents the procedures for validating geometries, geocoding
building addresses, filtering records, and assigning buildings to parcels.

Purpose:
    Transform raw, heterogeneous source data into a clean, spatially precise
    building inventory where every target-LU building is accurately geocoded
    to its host land parcel.

Reference:
    See Section 3 of the associated paper for the data preparation workflow.
    All steps are platform-agnostic — any GIS software (ArcGIS, QGIS, PostGIS)
    or scripting library (GeoPandas, sf in R) can be used.

Inputs:
    - Raw building inventory (from Stage 1)
    - Land parcel geometries (from Stage 1)
    - Permitted uses layer (from Stage 2) — used only for cross-referencing
    - Satellite imagery (for manual correction of mislocated features)

Outputs:
    - data/intermediate/buildings_cleaned.shp
        Geocoded building points, each assigned to a parcel_id
    - data/intermediate/parcels_with_buildings.shp
        Parcel layer enriched with building counts and types per year

    # STEP 1: GEOMETRY VALIDATION AND REPAIR
    # ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    #
    # Land parcel geometries from assessment data may contain topological
    # errors: self-intersections, slivers, gaps, or invalid polygons.
    #
    # Procedure:
    #   1. Run geometry validity check on all parcel polygons
    #   2. Auto-repair using buffer(0) trick or ST_MakeValid equivalent
    #   3. Flag parcels with area < minimum threshold (e.g., 1 m²) as slivers
    #   4. Remove duplicate geometries (same parcel appearing twice)
    #   5. Verify no overlapping polygons within same municipality
    #
    # Tools: GeoPandas .is_valid, .buffer(0), or ArcPy Repair Geometry

    # parcels = load_shapefile(config["paths"]["parcels_shapefile"])
    # parcels = repair_invalid_geometries(parcels)
    # parcels = remove_slivers(parcels, min_area_sqm=1.0)
    # parcels = remove_duplicates(parcels, key="unique_id")

    # ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    # STEP 2: BUILDING RECORD FILTERING
    # ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    #
    # The raw building inventory may contain records irrelevant to the model.
    # Filter criteria (Section 3):
    #
    #   INCLUDE:
    #     - status == "Existing" — currently standing buildings
    #     - status == "Demolished" — historical record retained for temporal analysis
    #
    #   EXCLUDE:
    #     - status == "Proposed" — not yet built; speculative
    #     - status == "Under Construction" — incomplete; uncertain completion year
    #     - Records missing year_built (critical for temporal panel)
    #     - Records missing address AND coordinates (cannot geocode)
    #     - Records with year_built outside the study window
    #       (keep lag-initialization years: e.g., 2013+ for a 2015-2023 study)
    #
    # In the GTHA case study, the target LU types are:
    #   Retail, Industrial, Office
    # Residential and recreational buildings are excluded from the target set
    # but retained for contextual feature generation (e.g., residential density).

    # buildings = load_csv(config["paths"]["buildings_csv"])
    # buildings = buildings[buildings["status"].isin(["Existing", "Demolished"])]
    # buildings = buildings.dropna(subset=["year_built"])
    # buildings = buildings[buildings["year_built"] >= start_year - lag_years]
    # target_buildings = buildings[buildings["lu_type"].isin(["Retail", "Industrial", "Office"])]
    # context_buildings = buildings[~buildings.index.isin(target_buildings.index)]

    # ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    # STEP 3: GEOCODING AND COORDINATE VALIDATION
    # ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    #
    # Many building records have civic addresses but no coordinates, or have
    # coordinates that are imprecise (neighbourhood centroid rather than
    # actual building location).
    #
    # Procedure (Section 3):
    #   1. For records with existing coordinates:
    #      - Validate that point falls within study area boundary
    #      - Cross-check against satellite imagery for obvious misplacements
    #   2. For records with address only:
    #      - Batch geocode using a geocoding service (e.g., Google, ArcGIS,
    #        Nominatim/OpenStreetMap)
    #      - Retain geocoding confidence score; flag low-confidence matches
    #   3. For low-confidence or mislocated points:
    #      - Option A: Manual correction using satellite imagery / VGI (small datasets)
    #      - Option B: Automated correction using building footprint matching
    #        (e.g., snap point to nearest building footprint centroid from
    #        OpenStreetMap or Ecopia AI building footprint data)
    #   4. BOTTOM LINE: Every target building must be precisely geocoded
    #      to its host parcel. Unresolvable records are dropped with logging.

    # for record in target_buildings:
    #     if has_valid_coordinates(record):
    #         if not within_study_area(record.point, study_boundary):
    #             flag_for_review(record)
    #     else:
    #         record.point = geocode(record.address, service="arcgis")
    #         if record.geocode_confidence < 0.8:
    #             record.point = snap_to_nearest_footprint(record.point, footprints)
    #
    # unresolved = target_buildings[target_buildings.point.isna()]
    # log_dropped_records(unresolved, reason="geocoding_failure")
    # target_buildings = target_buildings.dropna(subset=["point"])

    # ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    # STEP 4: SPATIAL JOIN — ASSIGN BUILDINGS TO PARCELS
    # ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    #
    # Each geocoded building point is spatially joined to the parcel polygon
    # that contains it. This establishes the agent-to-observation link.
    #
    # Edge cases:
    #   - Point falls on parcel boundary → assign to larger parcel (or random)
    #   - Point falls outside all parcels (e.g., in road right-of-way)
    #     → snap to nearest parcel centroid within a tolerance (e.g., 50m)
    #   - Multiple buildings on one parcel → all retained; they form a "project"
    #     if built in the same year (see Section 3)
    #
    # GTHA validation: Average of 1.07 buildings per parcel (2023 snapshot),
    # confirming the parcel as a reasonable decision-making unit.

    # buildings_with_parcels = spatial_join(
    #     target_buildings, parcels,
    #     how="left", predicate="within"
    # )
    # # Handle unmatched points
    # unmatched = buildings_with_parcels[buildings_with_parcels["parcel_id"].isna()]
    # for record in unmatched:
    #     nearest = find_nearest_parcel(record.point, parcels, max_dist_m=50)
    #     if nearest is not None:
    #         record["parcel_id"] = nearest.unique_id
    #     else:
    #         log_dropped(record, reason="no_parcel_within_tolerance")

    # ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    # STEP 5: LIFECYCLE STATUS TAGGING
    # ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    #
    # For temporal analysis, each building must be classified by its lifecycle
    # state relative to each year in the study period:
    #
    #   - "new"         : year_built == current_year (a development event)
    #   - "existing"    : year_built < current_year AND not demolished
    #   - "demolished"  : year_demolished <= current_year (if demolition data available)
    #   - "redeveloped" : demolished and rebuilt (track via address matching)
    #
    # This tagging is performed during panel construction (Stage 4), but the
    # building records must carry the raw metadata (year_built, status,
    # year_demolished if available) established here.

    # ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
    # STEP 6: EXPORT CLEANED DATASETS
    # ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

    # target_buildings.to_file(config["paths"]["cleaned_buildings"])
    # parcels_enriched = summarise_buildings_per_parcel(parcels, target_buildings)
    # parcels_enriched.to_file("data/intermediate/parcels_with_buildings.shp")

    pass
